# Stock-Market-Project
This repository contains a crawler that downloads all the stock datas of S&amp;P500 companies and then trains an LSTM network individually for prediction. In end we get graphs of predicted vs real closing prices. There is an option of also saving the weights of network so that it can be used later.
